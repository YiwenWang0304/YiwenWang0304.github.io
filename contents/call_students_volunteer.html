<p>The student volunteer program is an indispensable part of EDBT/ICDT and provides opportunities for students to attend, assist, and network.</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Become a student volunteer</h3></b>

<p>
	Student volunteers is what keeps the conference running smoothly. You must have had student status for at least one semester during the academic year before EDBT/ICDT. We are more than happy to accept undergrad, graduate, and PhD students. We need friendly volunteers to help us out.
</p>
<p>
	You should send a one-page CV to the <a href="mailto:hugo.nicolau@tecnico.ulisboa.pt">SV Chair</a> until 2019 January 10th, 11:59pm GMT. Approximately 20 students will be chosen as SVs. We are aiming at having a mix of local and international SVs, as well as undergrad, graduate, and PhD students.
</p>
<p>
	If you are selected as an SV you should register to the conference by choosing ‘bank transfer’ as the payment method. You will not need to actually do the bank transfer, we will waive your registration fee.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Frequently Asked Questions</h3></b>

<p>
	<b>Q</b>: I want to skip orientation, or work less than 20 hours, or arrive on Tuesday, can I still be an SV?
</p>
<p>
	<b>A</b>: No, sorry these are minimum expectations we expect from everyone. If after you commit extenuating circumstances appear (e.g. tornados, volcanos erupting, and other strange things) please communicate with us (to <a href="mailto:hugo.nicolau@tecnico.ulisboa.pt">SV Chair</a>). All we ask is for you to communicate what your circumstances are as early as you realize a situation has come up.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q</b>: I didn’t get your emails and/or forgot to register by the deadline you sent us and I lost my spot as an SV, can I get it back?
</p>
<p>
	<b>A</b>: If this is due to you just not reading your emails, not taking care of your responsibilities, forgetting or similar things then the answer is NO, no you may not. If there are extenuating circumstances, please communicate with us (to <a href="mailto:hugo.nicolau@tecnico.ulisboa.pt">SV Chair</a>). All we ask is for you to communicate what your circumstances are as early as you realize a situation has come up. (Yes, we’ll repeat this often).

<p>

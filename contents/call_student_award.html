<p>These awards are named in memory of Christine Collet, who passed away earlier this year.  Christine was a Professor of Computer Science at Grenoble INP, and Head of the Heterogeneous and Adaptive Systems team at the Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory. Christine was a senior member of the EDBT community, as a long term member of the executive board and recent past president of the EDBT Association. She carried out these roles with good humour and enthusiasm, while still making sure that things were done. These awards reflect Christine's interest in computing education, and her track record in supporting others.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
	The EDBT/ICDT series of conferences is an established and prestigious forum for exchanging the latest research results in data management. EDBT and ICDT are held jointly since 2009. The annual venue is located in an attractive European location and provides unique opportunities for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore new ideas, techniques and tools, and to exchange experiences.
</p>
<p>	
	We invite you to submit a proposal for a workshop to be co-located with the main joint EDBT/ICDT 2019 conference. The proposal should focus on a specific research topic within database and information systems. Workshops will run on March 26, 2019, and can last for half a day or a full day.

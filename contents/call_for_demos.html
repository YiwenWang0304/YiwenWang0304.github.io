<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">EDBT 2019 Call for Demonstration Proposals</h2>
<p>
The International Conference on Extending Database Technology is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences related to data management.</p>
<p>
The EDBT demonstration program has become an important venue for sharing cutting-edge, prototype data management systems with the greater EDBT community. We solicit demonstration proposals that will showcase the most exciting new data management technologies. </p>

<p>We welcome demo papers on topics including, but not limited to:
	<ul>
		<li>Availability, reliability, and scalability</li>
		<li>Big data storage, processing and transformation</li>
		<li>Complex event processing and data streams</li>
		<li>Concurrency control, recovery, and transaction management</li>
		<li>Data management in clouds</li>
		<li>Data mining and knowledge discovery</li>
		<li>Data quality, curation, and provenance</li>
		<li>Data warehousing, large-scale analytics and ETL tools</li>
		<li>Emerging hardware and in-memory databases</li>
		<li>Experiments and analysis</li>
		<li>Graph databases and semantic web</li>
		<li>Heterogeneous databases, data integration</li>
		<li>Machine learning systems</li>
		<li>Middleware and workflow management</li>
		<li>Parallel, distributed and grid data management</li>
		<li>Privacy, trust and security in databases</li>
		<li>Query processing and optimization</li>
		<li>Scientific and statistical databases</li>
		<li>Semi-structured and linked data management</li>

		<li>Text databases and information retrieval</li>
		<li>Tuning, monitoring, benchmarking and performance evaluation User interfaces and data visualization</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Demonstrations may consist of software, hardware, or both. The emphasis of the EDBT demonstration program is on visionary, next generation systems requiring significant research and development effort.</p>
<p>Authors may include a description of the novel intellectual content of the underlying system and of its architecture. The demonstration proposal must include citations of the most relevant papers about the proposed system and any previous publications of that same system.</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Guidelines</h3></b>
<p>All submissions will be electronic via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edbt19" target="_blank">EasyChair</a>.</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>When submitting a demo paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their PC members they have a COI with as defined below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes are rejected.</p>
<p>A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:
	<ul>
		<li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
		<li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.</li>
		<li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.</li>
		<li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
		<li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
		<li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Evaluation Criteria</h3></b>
<p>Selection of demonstrations for presentation at EDBT is highly competitive. The evaluation criteria include both the audience experience and the novelty of the system. The proposal should also describe in detail what EDBT attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will the audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an interesting scenario or script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the demonstration?</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Length, file type, and formatting</h3></b>
<p><b>Length</b>: Demo papers (including bibliographic references) should not exceed 4 pages.</p>

<p><b>File type</b>: Each demo proposal is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for A4 paper and no more than 5 MB in file size. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.</p>

<p><b>Formatting</b>: Demo papers must be must follow the ACM Proceedings Format. Please make sure you are using the latest version. Modified ACM LaTeX2e style files with ISBN and copyright information for EDBT 2019 can be downloaded here: <a href="/files/acmart-edbt2019.cls" target="_blank">acmart-edbt2019.cls</a>, <a href="/files/sample-edbt2019.pdf" target="_blank">sample-edbt2019.pdf</a>, <a href="/files/sample-edbt2019.tex" target="_blank">sample-edbt2019.tex</a>. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.</p>

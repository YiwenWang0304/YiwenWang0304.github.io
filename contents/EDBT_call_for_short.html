<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">EDBT Call for Short Papers</h2>

<p>
	The International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) is a leading international forum for database researchers, developers, and users to present and discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences related to data management. Data management is an essential enabling technology for scientific, business, and social communities. Data management technology is driven by the requirements of applications across many scientific, business and social communities, and runs on diverse technical platforms associated with the web, enterprises, clouds and mobile devices. The database community has a continuing tradition of contributing with models, algorithms and architectures to the set of tools and applications that enable day-to-day functioning of our societies. Faced with the broad challenges of today?s applications, data management technology constantly broadens its reach, exploiting new hardware and software to achieve innovative results.
</p>

<p>
	EDBT 2019, which will be held in beautiful Lisboa, Portugal on March 26-29, 2019 (http://edbticdt2019.inesc-id.pt), invites submissions of short research papers that present original, previously unpublished work. Short papers provide an opportunity to describe significant work in progress or research that is best communicated interactively or graphically. Short papers may present speculative ideas, controversial research ideas, and new applications of known results. They should be inspirational and spark some discussion among attendees. 
</p>

<p>
	Submissions will be peer reviewed, and accepted submissions will be published in the conference proceedings. Each accepted submission will be presented as a poster during a poster session where researchers obtain direct feedback about their work from a wide audience.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Topics of Interest for Short Research Papers</h3></b>

<p>
	We encourage submissions of short research papers related to all aspects of data management defined broadly, and particularly encourage work on topics of emerging interest in the database research and development communities. We welcome papers on topics including, but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Availability, reliability, and scalability</li>
	<li>Big data storage, processing and transformation</li>
	<li>Complex event processing and data streams</li>
	<li>Concurrency control, recovery, and transaction management</li>
	<li>Data management in clouds</li>
	<li>Data mining and knowledge discovery</li>
	<li>Data quality, curation, and provenance</li>
	<li>Data warehousing, large-scale analytics and ETL tools</li>
	<li>Emerging hardware and in-memory databases</li>
	<li>Experiments and analysis</li>
	<li>Graph databases and semantic web</li>
	<li>Heterogeneous databases, data integration</li>
	<li>Middleware and workflow management</li>
	<li>Parallel, distributed and grid data management</li>
	<li>Privacy, trust and security in databases</li>
	<li>Query processing and optimization</li>
	<li>Scientific and statistical databases</li>
	<li>Semi-structured and linked data management</li>
	<li>Sensor and mobile data management</li>
	<li>Social networks and crowdsourcing</li>
	<li>Spatial, temporal, and geographic databases</li>
	<li>Text databases and information retrieval</li>
	<li>Tuning, monitoring, benchmarking and performance evaluation</li>
	<li>User interfaces and data visualization</li>
	<li>Visionary</li>
</ul>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Short Vision Papers</h3></b>
<p>
	We also invite the submission of short visionary papers. Visionary papers provide a forum for the identification and discussion of new or emerging areas, innovative or risky approaches, or emerging applications that will require extensions to established techniques. A visionary paper does not have to include results already but should:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Describe an area in which there is a need for significant new results; the vision articulated should be for research that may take years to investigate fully, and for which there may be scope for a variety of approaches.</li>
	<li>Motivate research in the area by making it clear that there are challenging problems to be solved, and that the solutions to these problems would be valuable</li>
	<li>Motivate future research in the area by making the case that there is a need for substantial technical contributions, such as the provision of new theoretical foundations, the development of new techniques or architectures, or the creation of new communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Visionary papers are reviewed by the same program committee as research papers. Visionary papers must be marked accordingly, by stating "Visionary" as subtitle in the submitted PDF, as well as by choosing "Visionary" as primary subject area.
</p>



<b><h3 style="color: black;">Submission Guidelines for Short Papers</h3></b>
<p>
	All submissions will be electronic <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edbt19" target="_blank">via Easychair</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Short research papers have a page limit of 4 pages.
</p>

<p>
	For further information on formatting instructions and submission restrictions, see below.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
	When submitting a short research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paperâ€™s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their PC members they have a COI with as defined below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes are rejected.
</p>
<p>
	A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
	<li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.</li>
	<li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.</li>
	<li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
	<li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
	<li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
</ul>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate submissions and novelty requirements</h3></b>
<p>A short research paper submitted to EDBT 2019 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after you submit a short research paper to EDBT, you must await the response from EDBT and only resubmit elsewhere if your paper is rejected (or withdrawn at your request) from EDBT.</p>
<p>All short research papers submitted to EDBT 2019 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is either (a) a paper of five pages or more presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a EDBT 2019 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication.</p>
<p>Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission.</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Length, file type, and formatting</h3></b>
<p>Length: Short research papers and visionary papers have a page limit of 4 pages (including references and appendices).</p>

<p>File type: Each paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for A4 paper and no more than 5 MB in file size. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.</p>

<p>Formatting: Short research papers must follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM Proceedings Format</a>. Please make sure you are using the latest 2017 version. Modified ACM LaTeX2e style files with ISBN and copyright information for EDBT 2019 can be downloaded from the <a href="http://edbticdt2019.inesc-id.pt/?EDBT_CFP" target="_blank">call for paper webpage</a> (Note: to test the EDBT 2019 style files, make sure you place them in the same directory where you extracted the standard ACM Proceedings Format). The font size, margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged.</p>

<p>Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.</p>

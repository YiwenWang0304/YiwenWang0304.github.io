<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Call for Tutorials</h2>
<p>
	We solicit proposals for tutorials for presentation at the EDBT/ICDT 2019 Joint Conference to be held in Lisbon, Portugal. Proposals must provide an in-depth survey of the selected topic with the option of describing specific works in depth. Proposals should include a meaningful summary of open issues in the area. The topic of the tutorial should be broad enough to attract a significant audience  and must include enough details to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.
</p>
